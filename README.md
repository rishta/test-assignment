Create a phone book on the internet:

* Phone book records are accessible for registered users
* Sharing of phone book records with other users (and cancel it)
* Phone book record: name, phone number (full CRUD)
* At least one unit test created
* At least one feature test created
* The application must use Docker
* Application is controlled using GUI or API (or both)

== Comments ==

* The api-platform documentation is largely outdated or otherwise incomplete. I have to RTFS often in addition to RTFM to understand how things are supposed to work. Currently I am fighting against DataPersisters which don't behave as expected (or documented).
* There are some semi-obsolete files left, for the purpose of taking a look at different approaches to things (eg. persisters vs lifecycle callbacks).
* not everything is has been tested yet (RTFS instead of CreatingTFS).
